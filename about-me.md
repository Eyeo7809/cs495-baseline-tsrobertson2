1. What programming languages have you used?
I've used Python, Java, and GDScript primarily, and have also lightly used HTML

2. Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.
I've coded mostly in classes, doing the assignments that we've had (everyhting from creating a banking system to making networks, and then on my video game side of course making games)

3. What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?
Up to this point, it's been my capstone game Cryptid Zoo (download at https://refractive-studio.itch.io/cryptid-zoo), but also my final project for game programming was pretty large too (AI Monster pathfinding, getting sound from user, etc. etc.)

4. What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
Honestly I don't know.  I don't think I've coded enough to know what I'm most comfortable with other than Godot.  I'm definitely comfortable with that form of coding, which is much closer to Python than Java, and I'm fairly good at understanding the systems and how they talk to each other.

5. What do you feel least comfortable doing?
I definitely feel least comfortable with tests and "clean coding principles"
